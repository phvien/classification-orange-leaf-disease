\chapter*{\Huge Abstract}
In this thesis, we present classification of orange leaf disease applied Support Vector Machines (SVM) using combination Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW), Color, Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG), GIST and Residual Networks (ResNet). In step features extraction from leaf disease dataset collected at 2 provinces Hau Giang and Dong Thap. Learns the SVM model from combination SIFT and BoVW, Color, HOG, GIST and ResNet to found difference the features of each kind of leaf disease. The numerical test result real dataset with 711 images of 5 kind, inside, 4 kind is leaf disease and 1 kind is leaf healthy popular appearance in garden houses show that our SVM model achieves an accuracy 90.84\%, more than when comparison with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model achieves an accuracy 42.95\% only.\\
